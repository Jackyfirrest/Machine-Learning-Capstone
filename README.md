# Machine-Learning-Capstone
Assisted the machine learning team in predicting cloud platform fees for clients. Conducted experiments on various models, including SARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and BigQuery. Implemented feature engineering and optimization techniques such as extreme value screening, rolling-based methods, and other strategies to enhance the performance of each model.
